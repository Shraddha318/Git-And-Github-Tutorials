Git and Github are different.
Git is a software tool installed locally on your computer. It is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that
helps track changes made to files, manage different versions, and collaborate effectively. Git works locally on
your system and doesn't require an internet connection for most operations.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides an online platform
to store repositories remotely, collaborate with others, review code, manage issues, and host your projects
publicly or privately.


=> Repo
- Git on System vs Tracking:
1. git --version: Checks the installed version of Git on your local machine.
2. git status: Displays the current status of your repository, showing staged, unstaged, and untracked files.
3. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in your project directory (this command is used only once per project).
4. .git: A hidden folder created by git init, which stores all the history and metadata related to file changes within your repository

=> Commit
1. git init:create file or files
2. git add file1 file2
3. git status: Check staged files
4. git commit -m "add file"
5. git log : View detailed commit history
6. git log --oneline : For concise commit history
